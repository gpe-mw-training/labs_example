== Lab Title

Describe in this first paragraph an introduction knowledge about what is about to happen in the lab, and the knowledge the student will get, sort of "selling the lab" and generate expectation. Describe the Business Use case and lab predecessors.

== Editor

I like the link:https://atom.io/[Atom editor] with link:https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc preview package] to preview my labs, you of course can use your preferred flavor.

The .adoc files in gitHub are rendered in a visible format for the students, if you share the gitHub repository with them, it will be happily displayed as intended (sort of, there is a small gap between the local preview and the live format at gitHub). If you would like to share an html format instead, I recommend using link:https://asciidoclive.com/edit/scratch/1[Asciidoc live].
